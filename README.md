### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 23 years old, I am from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. I am senior security consultant and penetration tester with 3 years of experience. Generally I have a wide surface of knowledge due to the specifics of the security consultant job. In my main activities I focus on researching web applications and API, source code reviews, cloud deployment reviews (AWS mostly), developing open-source security tools, writing public articles, researches and methodologies.

I am always open to partnerships and interesting projects.
